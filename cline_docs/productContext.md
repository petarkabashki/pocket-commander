# Product Context

## Why this project exists
Pocket Commander is an **extendable agentic AI workflow engine**, built upon the **PocketFlow framework**. Its primary purpose is to provide a solid and flexible foundation for developers to **create and deploy custom agentic automation tools**. It moves beyond the concept of a simple personal assistant to become a platform for building sophisticated AI agents.

## What problems it solves
This project addresses the need for a streamlined way to:
- Develop AI agents capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks.
- Integrate various tools and data sources into agentic workflows.
- Manage and orchestrate the behavior of these agents using a clear and concise framework (PocketFlow).
- Provide a starting point for building specialized AI-powered automation solutions without needing to build the core agentic infrastructure from scratch.

## How it should work
Pocket Commander should:
- **Understand natural language queries** to initiate and guide agentic workflows.
- **Leverage the PocketFlow framework** to define, manage, and execute these workflows. This involves a system of interconnected "Nodes" (processing units) and "Flows" (sequences of Nodes).
- **Utilize a flexible tool-based architecture**, allowing easy integration of new capabilities (e.g., data fetching, API interaction, custom logic).
- **Operate asynchronously** for efficient handling of tasks.
- **Provide an interactive terminal interface** for development, testing, and direct interaction with the agents and their workflows.
- Be **configurable** through YAML files, allowing users to define modes of operation, toolsets, and agent behaviors.
- Serve as a **basis for implementing custom agentic automation tools**, meaning its architecture should be clear, modular, and easy to extend.
