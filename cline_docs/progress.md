# Progress

## What works
-   **Core Agentic Workflow Engine Foundation:**
    -   Basic structure for PocketFlow `Nodes` and `Flows` is in place ([`pocket_commander/nodes/`](pocket_commander/nodes/:1), [`pocket_commander/flows/`](pocket_commander/flows/:1)).
    -   Logic for LLM calls with tool support, including dynamic tool execution, exists within [`pocket_commander/nodes/tool_enabled_llm_node.py`](pocket_commander/nodes/tool_enabled_llm_node.py:1) (though parts may be refactored to utils).
    -   Example tools like `get_weather`, `get_stock_price`, and `search_web` are defined in [`pocket_commander/tools/`](pocket_commander/tools/:1), demonstrating the tool integration mechanism.
-   **Interactive Terminal Interface:**
    -   A functional terminal interface ([`pocket_commander/terminal_interface.py`](pocket_commander/terminal_interface.py:1)) using `prompt-toolkit` and `rich` allows for interaction with the engine.
    -   Supports built-in commands for navigation and control (`/help`, `/commands`, `/modes`, `/mode <name>`, `/exit`).
    -   Modes, representing different agent configurations or master flows, are configurable in [`pocket_commander.conf.yaml`](pocket_commander.conf.yaml:1) and loaded dynamically from [`pocket_commander/modes/`](pocket_commander/modes/:1).
    -   Mode switching is operational.
    -   Initial `main` and `composer` modes exist as placeholders for more complex agent implementations.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   `README.md` and `cline_docs/` have been updated to reflect the project's nature as an extendable agentic AI workflow engine based on PocketFlow.

## What's left to build
-   **Enhance Core Engine & Developer Experience:**
    -   Refactor utility functions from [`pocket_commander/nodes/tool_enabled_llm_node.py`](pocket_commander/nodes/tool_enabled_llm_node.py:1) to a dedicated module in [`pocket_commander/utils/`](pocket_commander/utils/:1) (e.g., `agent_utils.py` or `pocketflow_helpers.py`) to improve modularity for those building custom agents.
    -   Solidify and document conventions for creating new Nodes, Flows, and Tools to make it easier for users to extend the engine.
-   **Develop Example Agents/Flows:**
    -   Implement more sophisticated PocketFlow graphs within the existing `main` and `composer` modes (or new example modes) to showcase the engine's capabilities beyond simple echo/placeholder logic. These should demonstrate practical agentic workflows.
-   **Tooling & Integrations:**
    -   Address the coroutine issue with the `get_stock_price` tool (as noted in `activeContext.md`) to ensure tool reliability.
    -   Explore adding more diverse example tools.
-   **Testing & Robustness:**
    -   Implement a testing strategy for nodes, flows, and tools.

## Progress status
-   **COMPLETED:** Core terminal interface with mode support implemented.
-   **COMPLETED:** Initial documentation pass to define the project as an agentic workflow engine (README, cline_docs).
-   **IN PROGRESS:** Refining the core engine components and improving documentation for developers looking to build custom agentic solutions.
-   Next steps involve fleshing out example agentic flows, addressing the `get_stock_price` tool issue, and further enhancing the developer experience for extending the engine.
