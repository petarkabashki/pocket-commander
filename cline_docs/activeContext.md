# Active Context

## What you're working on now
Phase 9 (Update Documentation) is complete.
Phase 10 (Thorough Testing) is now the active task.

## Recent changes
- **Phase 9 (Update Documentation) Complete:** All relevant `cline_docs` and user documentation have been updated to reflect the completion of the Agent System Refactor (Phase 8).
- **Phase 8 (Refactor Existing Agents: `main`, `composer`, `tool-agent`) Complete:** The refactoring of the core agents to align with the new event-driven, PocketFlow-based architecture is finished.
- **New Agent System Implemented:**
    - Agents are now discoverable PocketFlow Nodes or Flows.
    - YAML-based configuration for agents is in place ([`pocket_commander.conf.yaml`](pocket_commander.conf.yaml:1)).
    - A Pub/Sub event mechanism using `AsyncEventBus` ([`pocket_commander/event_bus.py`](pocket_commander/event_bus.py:1)) handles agent and application communication.
    - Core event types (`AppInputEvent`, `AgentOutputEvent`, `AgentLifecycleEvent`) are defined in [`pocket_commander/events.py`](pocket_commander/events.py:1).
    - `AgentConfig` ([`pocket_commander/types.py`](pocket_commander/types.py:1)) defines agent structure.
    - `AgentResolver` ([`pocket_commander/agent_resolver.py`](pocket_commander/agent_resolver.py:1)) handles agent discovery and loading.
- **Memory Bank Initialization:** All Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) were read to establish full context for the documentation update task.

## Next steps
1.  **Phase 10: Thorough Testing:** Verify agent discovery, event flows, input handling, tool integration (placeholder), YAML configurations, and dedicated input requests.
