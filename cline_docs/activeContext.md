# Active Context

## What you're working on now
The current task is to update the project documentation, specifically the `README.md` and the `cline_docs/` files, to accurately reflect that Pocket Commander is an **extendable agentic AI workflow engine based on the PocketFlow framework**, and serves as a **basis for implementing custom agentic automation tools**.

## Recent changes
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new project positioning.
- Updated `cline_docs/productContext.md` to align with the new project positioning.

## Next steps
- Review and update `cline_docs/systemPatterns.md` and `cline_docs/techContext.md` if necessary to ensure they align with the refined project description (emphasizing PocketFlow and agentic engine aspects).
- Confirm all `cline_docs/` are consistent with the project's nature as an agentic workflow engine.
- Once all documentation updates are complete, mark this task as finished.
